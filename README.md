# Arc-Undead
##### A simplified GTK3 Arc Theme

Disclaimer: Credit for most of this goes to the original Arc Theme.

This theme aims to be easy to configure. All you need to do is edit the `gtk.css` file and the `assets.svg` file.
Then you'll have to generate the assets using `render-assets.sh`, this will require `inkscape` and optionally `optipng` for smaller images.
After that you'll have to decide on a name for your theme. For setting the name all you need to do is edit the `index.theme` file.
That's it! Now you can run `install.sh` and your theme is good to go.
